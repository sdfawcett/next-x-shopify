                  Cannabidiol (commonly known as CBD) is one of the main cannabinoid compounds found within the Cannabis Sativa plant. It is mainly derived from hemp, which is a separate and distinct strain of the cannabis plant than marijuana. Despite CBD being found in both hemp and marijuana, they are not one and the same.
               </p>

               <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
                  CBD is also different from THC, the other main cannabinoid in cannabis, in that it does not produce psychoactive effects or create a high.

               <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
                  Instead, CBD has been found to have a wide range of benefits. That’s because humans have what’s called an endocannabinoid system, a network of receptors that use CBD. Many have found CBD to be an effective remedy for everyday life.
