               <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
                  Our team has spent countless hours working with cat owners and vets to figure out how best to bring the joys of CBD to our beloved felines. We started off with an understanding that CBD products impact dogsâ€™ nervous systems in much the same way that they do humans. Meaning that they instill a sense of calm while reducing pain signals from throughout the body.
               </p>

               <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
                  The questions quickly became: what dosage and when?
               </p>

               <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
                  That took trial and error, with our team working with the best in the field to find the right answer. Finally, we realized that the dosage must be tempered to meet the overall weight of the cat, with the dosage timing being similar to that of humans.
               </p>

               <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
                  It is with that knowledge in mind that we have crafted this product, perfect for dogs and cats of all shapes and sizes. Our production method, which uses the latest in effective CO2 extraction to produce a healthy and all-natural full-spectrum CBD oil product, has everything you need to help your cat live his best life.
